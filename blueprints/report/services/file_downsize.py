"""Best-effort file downsizing to a 1 MB target.

Used before persisting uploaded receipts to S3 so storage and presigned-URL
payloads stay small.

Large images are always encoded as JPEG: PNG's exhaustive ``optimize`` pass is
the dominant CPU/RAM cost and the main worker OOM/timeout source for big
receipt uploads, and JPEG is far smaller and cheaper. Because the output format
can differ from the input, ``downsize_bytes`` returns the resulting mime type
alongside the bytes so callers can fix the stored file extension / metadata.

If the file cannot be brought under the target, the smallest produced variant
is returned anyway — callers should not block on size.
