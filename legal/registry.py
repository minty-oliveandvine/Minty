"""The published legal documents: their versions, effective dates and fingerprints.

A MANIFEST, NOT THE DOCUMENTS
-----------------------------
The documents themselves left this app on 2026-10-12. The `.md` files, the
Markdown renderer and the public pages now live in **minty-web**
(`minty-web/lib/legal/`, served at `/terms` and `/privacy`), which is where
anyone reads them. What stays here is the table below: which versions exist,
when each took effect, and what each one's SHA-256 is.

The split: **this app names the version; minty-web supplies the text.** This
side owns the record (`terms_consent`) and therefore has to own the version a
consent row may name, and the fingerprint stamped into it. If both apps decided
which version was live, a deploy skew would refuse sign-ups.

WHY A FINGERPRINT
-----------------
Recording "this person accepted beta-1" proves they clicked a button with a
label on it. It does not prove what the document said. So every consent row
also stores the SHA-256 of the exact wording shown, and this table is where
that number comes from — never the client, which sends one only so it can be
COMPARED (`blueprints/legal/routes/hub.py`).

The hash is taken over the `.md`, never a PDF: PDF writers embed a creation
timestamp, so building the same PDF twice yields two different fingerprints.
It is computed over text normalised to `\\n` endings with trailing whitespace
stripped and one trailing newline — part of the definition of the fingerprint,
not an implementation detail, and minty-web's
`lib/legal/registry.server.ts::normalise` is the same function. It must not
change once anything is published.

KEEPING THE TWO IN STEP
-----------------------
`MANIFEST` and minty-web's `PINNED_HASHES` are the same table, and a version
added or repinned in one must be changed in the other in the same breath.
`verify_manifest()` can no longer check a hash against a file — there is no
file here any more. What catches a divergence:

  1. minty-web's `lib/legal/__tests__/registry.test.ts` — re-hashes every `.md`
     and holds `c90a335e…` as a frozen literal.
  2. `tests/test_legal_manifest.py` — this table's invariants.
  3. `verify_manifest()` at startup — a live version with no manifest entry.
  4. The stack e2e job — the two RUNNING services compared.
  5. `POST /api/me/terms/accept`'s 409 `document_mismatch` — the last line.

A version whose `pinned` is False is still a DRAFT: its wording is not final
and it shows a draft notice. Pin it (and only then) when the wording is final.
